# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
In this exercise, we created a tracker for a bus route between MIT and Harvard. When you click on the button we created, it moves the tracker to the next bus stop, all the way until it reaches Harvard. We also were introduced to MapBox during this activity.

How to Run:

1. Download files locally
2. Create a MapBox account and load your access token into the mapanimation.js file
3. Load the index.html file onto your web browser
4. Click on the button "Show bus stops between MIT and Harvard"
5. Watch the marker move to the next bus stop every time you click on the button

Future Improvements:

1. Show where a bus is at in real time
2. Create a bus tracker for the city I live in
